# Herald 🎏

This was inspired by the sunsetting of [pico.sh/feeds](https://blog.pico.sh/ann-033-moving-rss-to-email-pico-plus) being available outside of `pico+`. It is a totally understandable move from them as their email costs were skyrocketing and they needed to pay for it somehow. This was created to allow me to still get my rss feeds delivered to me each day by email which I have grown quite accustomed to. The config is completely compatible with the `pico.sh` format as of `2026-01-09` and should stay fairly stable. It is also configured over ssh with the slight addition that you can view your feeds on a website as well as I found myself wanting to hot load my feeds into my website :)

The canonical repo for this is hosted on tangled over at [`dunkirk.sh/herald`](https://tangled.org/@dunkirk.sh/herald)
